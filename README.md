# atlas2freesurfer
 warp atlases to freesurfer space and extract fmri timeseries

(C) C. Vriend - Amsterdam UMC - Jan 10 2023
 this script allows you to warp several atlases to subject-specific freesurfer parcellations and use those to extract timeseries from smoothed and denoised functional MRI scans.


 the pipeline has been optimized for use on the luna server of Amsterdam UMC in combination with SLURM arrays to run the pipeline for all freesurfer  / fmriprep output in the folders.
